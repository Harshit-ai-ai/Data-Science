Projects So Far
1. Small Datasets from Home
Started small—with raw Excel sheets from my mother's former job. These datasets helped me practice handling inconsistencies, missing values, and structural issues commonly seen in real-world data.

2. Credit Card Transactions Dataset (Kaggle)
Used a real-world dataset to apply outlier detection techniques. Focused on identifying fraudulent transactions using:-
-Tukey’s IQR method
-Z-Score
-Isolation Forest (planned)

Tools & Technologies:-
-Python
-Pandas, NumPy
-Matplotlib, Seaborn
